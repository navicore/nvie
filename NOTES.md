PIVOT to GATEWAY API
=========

1. Deep Dive into the Gateway API
Familiarize Yourself

    Documentation: Start with the official Kubernetes Gateway API documentation
    to understand the concepts, resources, and their relationships. Community
    Resources: Engage with community resources such as tutorials, webinars, and
    GitHub discussions to gain deeper insights and practical knowledge.

Understand the API Design

    Resource Hierarchy: Study the resource model including GatewayClass,
    Gateway, HTTPRoute, TCPRoute, etc., and their intended use cases. Core
    Concepts: Grasp core concepts such as multi-tenancy support, declarative
    configuration, and the separation of concerns between different roles (e.g.,
    cluster operators, application developers).

2. Setting Up Your Development Environment
Tools and Technologies

    Kubernetes Cluster: Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up for
    development and testing, using Minikube, kind, or a cloud-based Kubernetes
    service. Rust Development: Set up your Rust development environment,
    focusing on async programming and network programming libraries.

Project Skeleton

    Cargo Project: Initialize a new Cargo project for your Gateway API
    implementation. Structure: Define a modular project structure that allows
    for scalability and easy maintenance.

3. Implementing Core Features
Gateway API Resources

    Resource Watching: Implement logic to watch and react to changes in Gateway
    API resources using the kube-rs crate or similar libraries. Routing Logic:
    Develop the core routing logic for different types of routes (e.g.,
    HTTPRoute, TCPRoute) according to the Gateway API specifications.

Traffic Handling

    Networking: Utilize Rust's asynchronous networking libraries to handle
    ingress and potentially egress traffic based on the Gateway API resources'
    configurations.

4. Extensibility and Compliance
Extensibility

    Custom Filters and Actions: Consider how to implement support for custom
    filters and actions as described by the Gateway API, allowing for future
    extensibility.

Compliance and Testing

    Conformance Testing: Keep an eye on Gateway API conformance tests (as they
    become available) to ensure your implementation is compliant with the
    specifications.

5. Monitoring, Logging, and Observability
Integration

    eBPF for Observability: Explore using eBPF for advanced monitoring and
    observability features, capturing metrics and logs relevant to the Gateway
    API traffic handling.

Exposing Metrics

    Prometheus: Ensure your implementation exposes metrics in a
    Prometheus-compatible format for easy integration with monitoring tools.

6. Documentation and Community Engagement
Documentation

    Comprehensive Docs: Write clear, comprehensive documentation covering setup,
    configuration, and usage of your Gateway API implementation.

Community Engagement

    Feedback and Collaboration: Engage with the Kubernetes and Gateway API
    communities for feedback, contributions, and to stay updated with the latest
    developments.

7. Continuous Learning and Contribution

    Stay Informed: Keep up with the Gateway API's evolution, participating in
    SIG-Network meetings or discussions to contribute to and learn from the
    ongoing development of the API.
