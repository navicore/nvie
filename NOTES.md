1. Foundation and Planning
Understanding Concepts and Tools

    Kubernetes Ingress: Research how Ingress controllers work, their role in
    managing access to services inside a Kubernetes cluster, and their
    interaction with other K8s resources. Rust Language: Ensure a good
    understanding of Rust, focusing on asynchronous programming, network
    programming, and familiarity with the Tokio runtime or any other async
    runtime in Rust. eBPF for Monitoring and Logging: Learn how eBPF works,
    especially in the context of networking and Kubernetes. Look into existing
    tools like bcc or bpftrace for examples.

Project Setup

    Environment Setup: Install Rust, Kubernetes (Minikube or kind for local
    testing), and any necessary Rust tooling (e.g., cargo, clippy). Project
    Structure: Initialize your Rust project with Cargo. Plan your module
    structure focusing on clarity and maintainability.

2. Core Development
Ingress Controller Basics

    K8s API Interaction: Use the kube-rs crate to interact with the Kubernetes
    API. Start with watching Ingress resources and understanding how to react to
    their changes. Networking: Implement the basic networking logic to route
    external requests to the correct services within the cluster. Libraries like
    hyper (HTTP) and tokio (async I/O) will be helpful here.

Simple Routing Logic

    Path-based Routing: Start with implementing path-based routing. Parse the
    incoming HTTP requests and route them to the correct service based on the
    Ingress rules. Service Discovery: Implement dynamic service discovery to
    resolve service names to their internal cluster IPs and ports.

3. Monitoring and Logging with eBPF
eBPF Integration

    eBPF Basics: Use the redbpf crate for integrating eBPF programs into your
    project. Focus on capturing networking events relevant to your ingress
    traffic. Metrics Collection: Design eBPF programs to collect metrics like
    request count, response status codes, and response times. Logging: Implement
    logging of HTTP request and response metadata for debugging purposes.

4. Observability and Operations
Monitoring Setup

    Metrics Export: Use Prometheus or another monitoring tool compatible with
    your eBPF metrics. Ensure your ingress controller exposes a metrics endpoint
    for scraping. Dashboard: Consider setting up a Grafana dashboard to
    visualize the metrics your controller reports.

Logging and Debugging

    Structured Logging: Use a Rust logging framework (e.g., tracing or log) for
    structured logging throughout your application. Integrate these logs with
    your eBPF-collected data for a comprehensive view. Testing and Validation:
    Write unit and integration tests, particularly for your routing logic and
    eBPF programs. Test your controller in a real Kubernetes cluster to validate
    its behavior under different scenarios.

5. Documentation and Sharing

    Write Documentation: Document the design and usage of your Ingress
    controller, including how to deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster and how to
    configure it. Open Source Contributions: Consider open-sourcing your project
    on GitHub. Provide clear installation instructions, usage examples, and
    contribution guidelines.

6. Iteration and Feedback

    Gather Feedback: Share your project with the Kubernetes and Rust communities
    for feedback. Engage with users and contributors to identify areas for
    improvement. Continuous Improvement: Iterate on your project based on
    feedback and your own observations. Consider adding more features like
    support for HTTPS, load balancing strategies, or more complex routing rules.

By following this plan, you'll learn about Kubernetes, Rust, network
programming, and observability in depth. The key to success in such a project is
to start with a simple, working version and iteratively enhance its capabilities
based on feedback and new learning.
